- If a SA_SIGINFO signal handler changes the ucontext_t pointed to by
  the third parameter, follow it after returning from the handler.


Bug Fixes
---------

- Fix select() on console in canonical mode.  Return after one line is
  completed, instead of when only one key is typed.

- Make console I/O functions thread-safe.
